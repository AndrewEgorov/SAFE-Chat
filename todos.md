# TODOs

## wrap up the project

* revise session abstraction
* revise what concludes user session
* determine user/session lifecycle (when to create flows)
* design API
* implement API
* client MVP


## ideas

Channel, ChatServer and user session are not stores but the streams/flows to process the data.
Keep track of disconnected users in channel vs separate channel descriptor (which keeps track of who's online).
